// Assignment 5C Mortage.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
// Prepro ideation please ignore...okay so. what imma have to do is... define the interest rate. Define how long a term is, use doubles for mort. and prin. ect and set decimal points to two
// then ill ask the user for their input. Then i'll call a function that uses those inputs and the given formula to calculate the outputs
