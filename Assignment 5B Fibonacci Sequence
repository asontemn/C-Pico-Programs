// Assignment 5B fibanocci.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//ideation: input formulas??? idk I gotta youtube this one.. okay so define two int vars numbers 0 and 1. Then define var for
// new number that is the sum of the pevious two then define a second var as the third num... 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int number, fib1 = 0, fib2 = 1, fibprev, nacci, fibnext, countup;

    cout << "How many fibs would you like me to print?: ";
    cin >> number; //how many of the fib series we will display

    for (int countup = 1; countup <= number; countup++) { // will loop x times to get x amount of fin #s
        cout << fib1 << " "; //print all the nums starting w zero BUT FIB1 changes each loop
        fibnext = fib1 + fib2;
        fib1 = fib2;
        fib2 = fibnext;
    }


}
